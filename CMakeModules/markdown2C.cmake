# CMake script file to process a text file by wrapping every line in double quotes.
# Input file must not abuse quotes, staying with single quotes is probably best.
# note also empty lines cannot be stripped: they have a meaning (separator) in markdown
# so we use file( READ ... ) to read the full file content, including empty lines

# Write the buffer between quotes
